    <h2>Appearance</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>Lynx have a short tail, characteristic tufts of black hair on the tips of their ears, large, padded paws for
        walking
        on snow and long whiskers on the face. Under their neck they have a ruff which has black bars resembling a bow
        tie,
        although this is often not visible.</p>
    <p>
        Body colour varies from medium brown to goldish to beige-white, and is occasionally marked with dark brown
        spots, especially on the limbs. All species of lynx have white fur on their chests, bellies and on the insides
        of their legs, fur which is an extension of the chest and belly fur. The lynx's colouring, fur length and paw
        size vary according to the climate in their range. In the <a
            href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwestern_United_States>
            Southwestern United States </a>, they are short-haired, dark in colour and their paws are smaller and less
        padded.
        As climates get colder and more northerly, lynx have progressively thicker fur, lighter colour, and their paws
        are larger and more padded to adapt to the snow. Their
        paws may be larger than a human hand or foot.
    </p>
    <p>The smallest species are the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobcat> bobcat </a> and the <a
            href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada_lynx> Canada lynx </a>, while the largest is the <a
            href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasian_lynx> Eurasian lynx</a>, with
        considerable variations within species.</p>

    <h2>Species</h2>
    <hr />

    <p>The four living species of the genus Lynx are believed to have evolved from the "Issoire lynx", which lived in
        Europe and Africa during the late Pliocene to early Pleistocene. The Pliocene felid <i><u>Felis
                rexroadensis</u></i> from North
        America has been proposed as an even earlier ancestor; however, this was larger than any living species, and is
        not
        currently classified as a true lynx.<sup><abbr title=Werdelin,Lars&lpar;1981&rpar;>11][12]</abbr>[</sup> </p>

    <h3>Eurasian lynx</h3>
    <p><small><i> &emsp;&emsp;Main article: <a href=www.wikipedia.com/euroasianlynx> Eurasian lynx </a> </i></small></p>

    <p>Of the four lynx species, the Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) is the largest in size. It is native to European, Central
        Asian, and Siberian forests. While its conservation status has been classified as "least concern", populations
        of
        Eurasian lynx have been reduced or extirpated from Europe, where it is now being reintroduced.</p>

    <p>The Eurasian lynx is the third largest predator in Europe after the brown bear and the grey wolf. It is a strict
        carnivore, consuming about one or two kilograms of meat every day. The Eurasian lynx is one of the
        widest-ranging.<sup>[13]</sup></p>

    <p> During the summer, the Eurasian lynx has a relatively short, reddish or brown coat which is replaced by a much
        thicker silver-grey to greyish-brown coat during winter. The lynx hunts by stalking and jumping on its prey,
        helped
        by the rugged, forested country in which it resides. A favorite prey for the lynx in its woodland habitat is roe
        deer. It will feed however on whatever animal appears easiest, as it is an opportunistic predator much like its
        cousins.<sup>[11]</sup> </p>


    <h3>Canada lynx</h3>
    <p><small><i> &emsp;&emsp;Main article: <a href=www.wikipedia.com/canadalynx> Canada lynx </a> </i></small></p>

    <p>The Canada lynx (Lynx canadensis), or Canadian lynx, is a North American felid that ranges in forest and tundra
        regions<sup>[14]</sup>across Canada and into Alaska, as well as some parts of the northern United States.
        Historically, the
        Canadian lynx ranged from Alaska across Canada and into many of the northern U.S. states. In the eastern states,
        it
        resided in the transition zone in which boreal coniferous forests yielded to deciduous forests.<sup>[15]</sup>
        By 2010, after
        an 11-year effort, it had been successfully reintroduced into Colorado, where it had become extirpated in the
        1970s.<sup>[16][17][18]</sup> In 2000, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service designated the Canada lynx a <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threatened_species#United_States"> threatened species </a> in
        the lower 48 states.<sup>[19]</sup></p>

    <p>The Canada lynx is a good climber and swimmer; it constructs rough shelters under fallen trees or rock ledges. It
        has a thick coat and broad paws, and is twice as effective as the bobcat at supporting its weight on the snow.
        The
        Canada lynx feeds almost exclusively on snowshoe hares; its population is highly dependent on the population of
        this
        prey animal. It will also hunt medium-sized mammals and birds if hare numbers fall.[14]</p>
